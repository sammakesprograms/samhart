# Day 1

Today I started using WebStorm for the first time. It feels very familiar as I've used other JetBrains IDEs, especially Rider, before. It handles everything like npm for me straight out of the box, which is incredibly helpful.

I created my Astro project and added Tailwind before adding some basic text to my website. It's going much better than I expected so far, but my expectations were extremely low, and I've only just started! There's so much more to go before I can get anything close to my current Squarespace website, but that's why drag-and-drop is so popular despite its limitations! I'd imagine it's much easier even for seasoned web developers.

Tools I used today:
