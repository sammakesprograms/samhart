# Day 3

I realised that I forgot to merge the branch with the Netlify badge for the README and messed up the commit history a little but the badge now works as intended.

I added skill icons for The Obsidian Trials along with alt text for all images used so far. I also added details about my role in the project.  

I started using JavaScript for the first time as I wanted to implement a lightbox for my game screenshots. I went with Svelte for my framework as I've heard good things about its developer experience and that it works particularly well with Tailwind.
