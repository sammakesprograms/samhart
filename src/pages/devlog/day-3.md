# Day 3

I realised that I forgot to merch the branch with the Netlify badge for the README and messed up the commit history a little but the badge now works as intended.

I added skill icons for The Obsidian Trials along with alt text for all images used so far.

Tools to date:
- Astro
- Tailwind
- npm
- Markdown
- WebStorm
- Adobe Illustrator
