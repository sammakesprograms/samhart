# Day 2

Tailwind has already been really useful for me, it distills down a lot of the mess of CSS which I greatly appreciate.  

I also implemented a basic navbar and pages for the devlog, portfolio and my first project (The Obsidian Trials).  

I briefly attempted to use VSCode but struggled to understand the UI and the JSON-based settings so I quickly reverted to WebStorm.

I quickly made a new favicon in the website using Adobe Illustrator, which I might reuse within the website for other purposes. I also replaced the README from Astro's minimal template with a new, from scratch README with new icons to show what tools I've used.  

I added the screenshots I have for The Obsidian Trials.

Tools to date:
- Astro
- Tailwind
- npm
- Markdown
- WebStorm
- Adobe Illustrator
