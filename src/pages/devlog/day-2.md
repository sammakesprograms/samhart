# Day 2

Tailwind has already been really useful for me, it distills down a lot of the mess of CSS which I greatly appreciate.  

I also implemented a basic navbar and pages for the devlog, portfolio and my first project (The Obsidian Trials).

Tools to date:
- Astro
- Tailwind
- npm
- Markdown
- WebStorm
- Git
- GitHub
- GitKraken
