    <p>The Obsidian Trials is a platforming game made by a small team of students in Unreal Engine 5 for the Ukie Games Jam 2025. I was responsible for implementing our checkpoint system as well as our player code. I also created and managed the code repository and helped to co-ordinate the team. I also made the final submission on itch.io.</p>

    </a>
    <p>Note: We used GitHub for version control during development as most of the team had only used GitHub before the game jam started. After the game jam was over I transferred the repository to GitLab to take advantage of its higher per-repository free storage limit. </p>
