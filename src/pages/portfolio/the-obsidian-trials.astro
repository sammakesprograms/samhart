    <p>The Obsidian Trials is a platforming game made by a small team of students in Unreal Engine 5 for the Ukie Games Jam 2025. I was responsible for implementing our checkpoint system as well as our player code. I also created and managed the GitHub repository and helped to co-ordinate the team.</p>
